# MKWS-2019-SD-Toolbox
This is half-semester project for subject "Computer Methods in Combustion" conducted on Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engineering, specialization Aerospace Engineering - Propulsion Systems. Authors of this project are Aleksander Kipiela, Micha≈Ç Forysiak and Hubert Demianowski. We tried to analyze influence for explosiveness when adding nitrogen to hydrogen-oxygen mixture. Main part of code is based on example found on github - https://github.com/saltazaur/cantera-jupyter/blob/master/demo/demo_ZND_CJ_cell.py

Whole code with comments is uploaded in "SD Toolbox hydrogen mixture explosiveness.py" file
